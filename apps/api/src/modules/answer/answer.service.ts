  /**
   * Save/update an answer for one question in an attempt.
   *
   * Two layers of guarding before anything is written:
   *  1. `assertAttemptIsWritable` — a fast, unlocked ownership/status/
   *     expiry pre-check (and triggers auto-submit-on-expiry as a side
   *     effect if needed).
   *  2. `withLockedInProgressAttempt` — the actual write happens inside
   *     this, which takes the SAME row lock submission-finalization uses.
   *     This is what prevents an answer from silently being written after
   *     (or lost around) a concurrent submit — see that method's doc
   *     comment in submission.service.ts for the full reasoning.
   *
   * Question-shape validation (`validateAnswerContent`) runs before the
   * lock is acquired — it only needs the question's own (immutable)
   * metadata, not attempt state, so there's no reason to hold a lock for it.
